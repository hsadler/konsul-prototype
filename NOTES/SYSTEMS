SYSTEMS


Galactic Grid:
    - horizontal and vertical lines per Unity unit of distance
    - origin is at center of black hole


Camera:
    - mouse wheel for zoom
    - mouse grab-drag for camera pan


Planetary Systems:
    - PlanetarySystemScript:
        - held within galaxy-scene-manager
        - contains references to all bodies scripts such as star, planets, etc.
        - provides an interface for randomization of system parameters
    - StarScript:
        - contains information about star size and luminosity
        - stars have interactable light beams
    - PlanetScript:
        - contains information about planet size, orbit path and speed, and composition
        - contains, as children gameObjects, orbit waypoints and orbit path lines
        - provides and interface for resource transfer


Worker Task Queue:
    - tasks are assigned to workers via a queue system
    - system behavior:
        - Player issues build or remove commands which causes Tasks to be created and added to the 
            WorkerTaskQueue system.
        - Tasks are pulled off the queue and matched with the closest Worker to the Task location.
        - Enforce Worker -> Task location max distance.
        - Once a Task is assigned to a Worker, the task becomes unavailable to other workers and 
            put in an "in-progress" status.
        - Worker attempts to carry out task.
        - If completed, the tasks is reported as completed to the WorkerTaskQueue system and destroyed.
        - If worker is interrupted and task is not able to be completed, the task is reported as incomplete 
            and put back in the queue as top priority.
        - If worker finds that tasks is unable to be completed, the task is reported as cancelled and is destroyed.
        - If the task is cancelled by an outside source, such as player input or an environment event, the
            task is reported as cancelled, and the worker is unassigned from the task.


Structure IO Filter:
    - The ability to apply either an include or exclude filter list to an existing structure-io
    - UX:
        - select structure
        - tab to desired io
        - press edit-key to enter structure-io-edit mode
        - select either include or exclude filter type
        - select factory-entities from a list of icons in order to build the filter list
        - press back-key to back out of structure-io-edit mode


Other likely systems:
    - more galactic object types
    - player code input to create, destroy, manipulate structures
    - resources
    - resource tree
