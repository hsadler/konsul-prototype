Factory + Space:
    - What can zero-gravity add to a factory game, as a twist on the genre?
        - launching
        - gravity bending straight paths
    - What can space add?
        - rockets
        - planets
        - stars
        - nebulae
        - asteroids
        - black holes
        - aliens
        

=======================================================================================


Guiding light problems for player to solve:
    - growing factory: resource gathering, production
    - organization: routing, sorting, distribution
    - power management: ensuring supply is greater than demand
    - expansion: traveling to additional systems, setting up bases and supply lines
    - progression: unlocking next tier of items, abilities, etc.


Early game progression:
    - game start:
        - one worker 
        - one storage containing a harvester
        - a "starter" planetary system
    - first player actions:
        - worker retrieves the harvester from storage
        - worker places the harvester which starts sending raw resources to the storage
        - worker retrieves resources from storage
        - worker uses resources to construct:
            - additional harvesters
            - additional storage
            - other factory structures


Long arc game progression:
    early-game: 
        - harvesting initial p-system
        - work way through the resource tree to the System Expansion Ship
        - expand to 2nd p-system
    mid-game:
        - multiple expansions and factory builds
        - connection of p-system factories with Haulers?
    late-game:
        - accomplish the end-game-thing (TBD)


Factory UX and rules things to think about:
    - Throughput of resource transfer
    - Who should manage the link relationships between factory structures? 
        Two way pointers? Output -> Input pointers?
    - What should be responsible for resource getting for building? Workers? A single player avatar? 
        If it is workers, there will need to be a queue system for tasks to be carried out.
    - Categorizing resource types:
        - raw
        - processed
        - structure
    - Should all resources live as game entities or should some be currencies?
    - Should all factory structure IO require resource type? How will the controls for this work?


Terminal Commands Player Input:
    - cursor in middle of screen
    - cursor displays coordinates 
    - cursor highlights current grid position



GAME ENTITIES AND SYSTEMS:

Grid style galaxy:
    - galaxy has a large black hole with stationary systems
    - each sytem has a star with square orbiting planets
    - resources of different types and ratios are present and extractable from the various galactic objects
    - resources can be routed and processed by structures
    - grid displays coordinates (terminal version of game)

Stars:
    - 4 types:
        - red
        - yellow
        - blue
        - white
    - 4 sizes
    - type informs luminosity
    - size informs amount and length of beams
    - power extractable via Photovoltaic

Planets:
    - resource types extractable:
        - water
        - gas
        - stone
        - metal
        - organics

Worker:
    - worker can:
        - fetch
        - place or build
    - player issues commands which are queued and carried out by workers
