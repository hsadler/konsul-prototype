IDEAS


Player experience POC:
    - scene start with presentation of galaxy
    - player controls:
        - move camera to view planetary systems
        - zoom camera
        - change mode to "placement" by pressing alphaNum key:
            * this mode should display a "ghost" form of the structure under the cursor 
            - click on galaxy grid to place
            - change placement selection by pressing different alphaNum key
            - change mode to "init" by pressing "Q"
        - change mode to "structure select" by clicking structure:
            * this mode should display information about the selected structure
            - select a different structure by clicking another
                (prototype will limit structure selection to one at a time)
            - change mode to "structure io" by pressing "spacebar": 
                - create output->input relationship by clicking another structure
                    (once this is completed, mode reverts to "structure select")
                - cancel io by pressing "Q" to go back to "structure select" mode
            - change mode to "init" by pressing "Q"


Grid style galaxy:
    - galaxy has a large black hole with stationary systems
    - each sytem has a star with square orbiting planets
    - resources of different types and ratios are present and extractable from the various galactic objects
    - resources can be routed and processed by structures
    - grid displays coordinates (terminal version of game)


Tech-Tree:
    - Gatherers
    - Routers
    - Load-balancers
    - Sorters
    - Storage
    - Processors
    - Power


Resources:
    - Light
    - Gases
    - Metals
    - Rocks
    - Water
    - Organics


Worker:
    - worker can:
        - carry
        - place
        - build
    - player issues commands which are queued and carried out by workers


Game progression design:
    - game start:
        - one worker 
        - one storage containing a harvester
        - a "starter" planetary system
    - first player actions:
        - worker retrieves the harvester from storage
        - worker places the harvester which starts sending raw resources to the storage
        - worker retrieves resources from storage
        - worker uses resources to construct:
            - additional harvesters
            - additional storage
            - other factory structures


Terminal Commands Player Input:
    - cursor in middle of screen
    - cursor displays coordinates 
    - cursor highlights current grid position


Factory UX and rules things to think about:
    - Throughput of resource transfer
    - Who should manage the link relationships between factory structures? 
        Two way pointers? Output -> Input pointers?
    - What should be responsible for resource getting for building? Workers? A single player avatar? 
        If it is workers, there will need to be a queue system for tasks to be carried out.
    - Categorizing resource types:
        - raw
        - processed
        - structure
    - Should all resources live as game entities or should some be currencies?
    - Should all factory structure IO require resource type? How will the controls for this work?


Maybes:
    - binary star systems
    - comets
    - asteriod fields
    - rogue planets
    - nebula
    - dark matter
    


MECHANICS:

Core Mechanics:
    - resource gathering
    - resource routing
    - resource processing


Other Mechanics:
    - upgrades

Stars:
    - 4 types:
        - red
        - yellow
        - blue
        - white
    - 4 sizes
    - type informs luminosity
    - size informs amount and length of beams

Planets:
    - resource types extractable:
        - water
        - gas
        - rock
        - metal
        - organic
