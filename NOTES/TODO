- Player factory building:
    - implement Harvester:
        - selection of Harvester should allow selection of output 
            to factory structures that allow inputs
        - harvester spawns Resource and sends in direction of output
    - implement Storage:
        - reference to inputs
        - should store resources that collide with it by destoroying 
            resource object and storing held resource state
    - get sending items from Harvester to Storage working
    - don't allow double placement


- Bugs:
    X structure reselection not working
    X don't allow resourceIO dupes
    X make resourceIOs work for all distances (including adjacent blocks)
