X move can-consume behavior to it's own script

- POC Worker:
    - factory-entity tracking:
        - add to player-factory manager
        - implement removal
    - worker ability to lookup storages and query for existance of items
    - worker ability to fetch storage items
    - implement worker carrying out tasks:
        - fetch and build
        - remove and store

- I'm probably using interfaces incorrectly. Research and possibly refactor to using classes and inheritance instead.

- POC early game progression:
    - figure out initial setting
    - player gets basic factory working
    - player begins expanding production

- POC power gathering from stars:
    - Photovoltaic
    - Mirror
    - PowerCell

- add music


For consideration/prioritization:
    - define output types for resource-IO
    - multiselect with selection box
    - consider a freeze-time control
    - consider different tiers of power gathering
        (though prob not for prototype)


- Bugs:
    - adjacent storages and distributors are consuming each other, modify colliders to be slightly smaller
    - factory-structures without resource-io behavior should not be able to go into transit-mode
    - bugfix why worker is not removable


- CLI:
    - TODO


Improvements and Polish:
    - polish black hole, need high-rez sprite image
    - prevent star overlap by implementing generation buffer
    - prevent planetary system overlap with black hole
