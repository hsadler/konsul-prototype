Next:
    X create admin mode:
        X admin should be able to:
            X instantly create structures and units
            X instantly destroy structures and units
            X populate storages with resources
    - POC Worker:
        - worker can:
            - fetch
            - place or build
        - player issues commands which are queued and carried out by workers
        - worker task queue system behavior:
            - Player issues build or remove commands which causes Tasks to be created and added to the 
                WorkerTaskQueue system.
            - Tasks are pulled off the queue and matched with the closest Worker to the Task location.
            - Enforce Worker -> Task location max distance.
            - Once a Task is assigned to a Worker, the task becomes unavailable to other workers and 
                put in an "in-progress" status.
            - Worker attempts to carry out task.
            - If completed, the tasks is reported as completed to the WorkerTaskQueue system and destroyed.
            - If worker is interrupted and task is not able to be completed, the task is reported as incomplete 
                and put back in the queue as top priority.
            - If worker finds that tasks is unable to be completed, the task is reported as cancelled and is destroyed.
            - If the task is cancelled by an outside source, such as player input or an environment event, the
                task is reported as cancelled, and the worker is unassigned from the task.
    - POC early game progression:
        - figure out initial setting
        - player gets basic factory working
        - player begins expanding production
    - POC power gathering from stars:
        - Photovoltaic
        - Mirror
        - PowerCell
    - add music


For consideration/prioritization:
    - define output types for resource-IO
    - multiselect with selection box
    - consider a freeze-time control
    - consider different tiers of power gathering
        (though prob not for prototype)


- Bugs:
    - 


- CLI:
    - TODO


Improvements and Polish:
    - polish black hole, need high-rez sprite image
    - prevent star overlap by implementing generation buffer
    - prevent planetary system overlap with black hole
