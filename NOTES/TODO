TODO


- POC Worker:
    - what's left:
        X add placement of placeholder factory-structure:
            X cursor-for-placement structure (when structure has been selected for placement and player is moving cursor to choose placement)
            X in-progress structure (the placeholder "ghost" structure prior to placement or build by worker)
        - bugfix why worker is not removable
        - implement worker carrying out task
- POC early game progression:
    - figure out initial setting
    - player gets basic factory working
    - player begins expanding production
- POC power gathering from stars:
    - Photovoltaic
    - Mirror
    - PowerCell
- add music


For consideration/prioritization:
    - define output types for resource-IO
    - multiselect with selection box
    - consider a freeze-time control
    - consider different tiers of power gathering
        (though prob not for prototype)


- Bugs:
    - 


- CLI:
    - TODO


Improvements and Polish:
    - polish black hole, need high-rez sprite image
    - prevent star overlap by implementing generation buffer
    - prevent planetary system overlap with black hole
