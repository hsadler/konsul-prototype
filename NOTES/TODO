- Player factory building:
    X placement of mock structure
    X player input structure selection
    X create factory structures:
        X Harvester
        X Storage
        X Merger
        X Splitter
        X Mirror
        X Photovoltaic
        X Accumulator
    - implement v1 player controls for factory building:
        X input modes
        X structure placement mode
        X structure placement
        X structure selection
        X structure reselection
        X structure io edit mode
        - transit line creation
        X remove mode
        - remove structure or transit line
    - implement Harvester:
        - selection of Harvester should allow selection of output 
            to factory structures that allow inputs
        - harvester spawns Resource and sends in direction of output
    - implement Storage:
        - reference to inputs
        - should store resources that collide with it by destoroying 
            resource object and storing held resource state
    - get sending items from Harvester to Storage working
    - don't allow double placement


- Bugs:
    X structure reselection not working
