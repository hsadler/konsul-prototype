Next:
    X rename "rock" to "stone"
    X implement Router
    X color RawResources based on raw resource type
    X information about factory structure upon selection and toggle
    X draft resource tree v1
    - POC Worker
    - POC early game progression
    - POC power gathering from stars:
        - Photovoltaic
        - Mirror
        - PowerCell
    - add music


For consideration/prioritization:
    - define output types for resource-IO
    - multiselect with selection box
    - consider a freeze-time control
    - consider different tiers of power gathering
        (though prob not for prototype)
