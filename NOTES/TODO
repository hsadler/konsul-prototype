X POC Worker:
    X factory-entity tracking:
        X add to player-factory manager
        X implement removal
    X worker ability to lookup storages and query for existance of items
    X worker ability to fetch storage items
    X implement worker carrying out tasks:
        X fetch and build
        X remove and store

X implement inventory FE behavior script
X implement buffer-queue FE behavior script for Distributor

- test and polish workers:
    - worker shouldn't fetch items if already in inventory
    - workers shouldn't deliver to storages marked for removal
    - worker should build structures from materials, not just placement
    - worker actions should take time:
        - rotating
        - retrieving
        - depositing
        - placing
        - building

- POC early game progression:
    - figure out initial setting
    - player gets basic factory working
    - player begins expanding production
    - player harnesses the power of the sun
    
- POC power gathering from stars:
    - Photovoltaic
    - Mirror
    - PowerCell

- add music


For consideration/prioritization:
    - storage capacity per storage and per worker
    - system for the cost of each factory entity
    - I'm probably using interfaces incorrectly. Research and possibly refactor to using classes and inheritance instead.
    - define output types for resource-IO
    - multiselect with selection box
    - consider a freeze-time control
    - consider different tiers of power gathering
        (though prob not for prototype)


- Bugs:
    - some selection vs. placement bugs
    - game object destroyed but still trying to be accessed in WorkerTaskQueue
    - factory-structures without resource-io behavior should not be able to go into transit-mode
    - bugfix why worker is not removable


- CLI:
    - TODO


Improvements and Polish:
    - polish black hole, need high-rez sprite image
    - prevent star overlap by implementing p-system buffer during generation
    - prevent planetary system overlap with black hole
