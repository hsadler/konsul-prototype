pre crafting system prep:
    X split-up constants into separate files
    X refactor rawResource to be InTransitFE which displays sprite of item in transit
    - add new resource sprites and system mappings:
        - NITROGEN
        - HELIUM
        - CO2
        - HYDROGEN
        - OXYGEN
        - SILICATES
        - QUARTZ
        - IRON
        - COPPER
        - ALUMINUM
        - LEAD
        - RARE_METALS
        - BIOMASS
        - CELL_CULTURE
    - implement Raw Resource Processor factory structure
    - get raw resource processing working
    - ability to define output types for resource-IO:
        - all IOs or only some structures?
        - think about UX/UI, something quick and easy for the prototype

- crafting system: resource cost of each factory entity

- add factory structures:
    - Furnace
    - Refinery
    - Assembler

- add music

- test and polish workers:
    - worker shouldn't fetch items if already in inventory
    - workers shouldn't deliver to storages marked for removal
    - worker should build structures from materials, not just placement
    - worker actions should take time:
        - rotating
        - retrieving
        - depositing
        - placing
        - building

- POC early game progression:
    - figure out initial setting
    - player gets basic factory working
    - player begins expanding production
    - player harnesses the power of the sun
    
- POC power gathering from stars:
    - Photovoltaic
    - Mirror
    - PowerCell


For consideration/prioritization:
    - give in-transit entities a TTL
    - I'm probably using interfaces incorrectly. Research and possibly refactor to using classes and inheritance instead.
    - consider a freeze-time control
    - consider different tiers of power gathering
        (though prob not for prototype)


- Bugs:
    - factory-structures without resource-io behavior should not be able to go into transit-mode


- CLI:
    - TODO


Improvements and Polish:
    - polish black hole, need high-rez sprite image
    - prevent star overlap by implementing p-system buffer during generation
    - prevent planetary system overlap with black hole
