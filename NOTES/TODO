- Player factory building:
    X don't allow double placement of structures or resource-ios
    X implement Harvester:
        X selection of Harvester should allow selection of output 
            to factory structures that allow inputs
        X harvester spawns Resource and sends in direction of output
    - implement Storage:
        - should store resources that collide with it by destoroying 
            resource object and storing held resource state
    - get sending items from Harvester to Storage working


- Bugs:
    X structure reselection not working
    X don't allow resourceIO dupes
    X make resourceIOs work for all distances (including adjacent blocks)
