Next:
    - create admin mode:
        - admin should be able to:
            - instantly create structures and units
            - instantly destroy structures and units
            - populate storages with resources
    - POC Worker:
        - worker can:
            - fetch
            - place or build
        - player issues commands which are queued and carried out by workers 
    - POC early game progression:
        - figure out initial setting
        - player gets basic factory working
        - player begins expanding production
    - POC power gathering from stars:
        - Photovoltaic
        - Mirror
        - PowerCell
    - add music


For consideration/prioritization:
    - define output types for resource-IO
    - multiselect with selection box
    - consider a freeze-time control
    - consider different tiers of power gathering
        (though prob not for prototype)


- Bugs:
    - 


- CLI:

Improvements and Polish:
    - polish black hole, need high-rez sprite image
    - prevent star overlap by implementing generation buffer
    - prevent planetary system overlap with black hole
